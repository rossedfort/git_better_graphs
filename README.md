### GitBetter Graphs

### Pitch

GitBetter Graphs is an app for programmers who want better representation their Github data

### Problem

Github is a powerful tool for all programmers, however the graphs and statistics provided are less than ideal.
GitBetter Graphs aims to improve upon, and offer new interpretations of Github's graphs.

### Solution

By consuming Github's public API and graphing the data returned with D3js, this application will provide
more powerful and in depth graphs.

### Target Audience

This application is for anyone with a Github account, particularly users who are more interested in the data they
create, and employers or recruiters who want a quick glance at a potential employee's statistics.

### Integrations

* This app will consume the Github API through the Octokit gem
* The graphs will be built using D3js
